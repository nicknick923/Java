CS 2430 - Lab 1 - To Get you started on Program 1  

For this lab, you will be starting Program 1.  

0. You must use CSSE Hub to keep an up-to-date log of the time spent working.
   You must use the automatic punch in and punch out when possible.

   Make sure that you log your time for project named: Prog1.

   Provide specific comments about what you worked on during that period.
   Access CSSE Hub from http://www.uwplatt.edu/csse page, choose Resources,
   then CSSE Course Materials and then "CSSE Hub".


1. On your J drive, make a Prog1 folder.   

2. Follow the directions as in the Program 0 description to make  project 
   and add Prog1.java to it by copying it into the src folder. 

3. The next 2 steps help you to create two files:
       Device.java and DeviceManager.java

4. Start the class for DeviceManager.java.  Use File/New File to create it.
   Select Java for Cagegory and Java Class for File type.
   Click Next button and for Class Name type in:    DeviceManager

   Copy and paste the following into your class.  
   Make sure to NOT have 2 lines of "public class DeviceManager"
   and correct number of matching curly braces.

import java.util.Scanner;
public class DeviceManager
{
       
   public void run()
   {
      System.out.println("In the run method");
   }
}

This is a "STUB" for the run method.  Later, we will use the run method as 
a "DRIVER" to test methods in Device.java.  Save, then add this file 
to your project.  

Build & run Prog1.  
                                             
5. Start the class for Device.java as done in the step above.


public class Device
{
   private String name;         // name of the Device
   private float readings[];    // array of readings
   private int curIndex;        // index where next reading goes

   // Initialize name to deviceName, curindex to zero
   // Create an array of numReadings float value [Hint: use new] 
   // Initialize all elements of the array to zero.
   public Device ( String deviceName, int numReadings, float initValue  )
   {







   }

}

Build and run.  

6. Adding in methods one at a time.  Do the toString method first.
      a. Add a toString method to Device (see Prog1 description &
         see the notes.)
      b. Add the following code to the DeviceManager run method:
         Device myDevice = new Device( "Speedometer", 5, 0.0 );
         System.out.println(myDevice);      
      c. Compile until all errors are gone, then RUN it.

7. Add in the other 2 methods one at a time, as in 6 above. See the
Program 1 description for hints as to what the code does.
For each method you write, add a call in the DeviceManager run method 
to call the method and write the results (a simple TEST of the method).  
Then compile, run to see that each one works.
